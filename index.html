            Mulberry, Fla. 4-4-9<br>
            Dear Jasper just a few lines we are all well hope you all are well too. Sis & Pete have both settled. I was so glad to hear from you all tell her I will send you all each one a box of oranges the last of next week. There is a packing house here. She said I must come to see them and write if I can't come. If they will pay my fare I will leave here for Orange about 22 you must come to Orange I canâ€™t tell yet what day I can come there but will let her know Saturday. I must tell Jessie I wrote her a card two weeks ago no answer. You must write me before I leave here and tell me the news. Your Pa J.B.S.

        <p>
            The discovery of this postcard from 1909 provides a rare and intimate glimpse into the lives of an ordinary family in early 20th-century Florida and South Carolina. The letter, penned by J.B.S. from Mulberry, a small town in Polk County, Florida, is addressed to his son, Jasper, residing in Florence, South Carolina. This correspondence captures the daily realities, familial concerns, and economic activities of the time, shedding light on the lives of ordinary people in the Southeast.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mulberry, known for its phosphate mining industry, was a burgeoning town in the early 1900s. The letter mentions a local packing house, likely for citrus fruits, indicating that J.B.S. was involved in the agricultural sector. During this period, Polk County was a prominent center for citrus production, contributing significantly to Florida's economy. The reference to sending a box of oranges underscores the region's agricultural backbone and highlights the importance of citrus farming to the local economy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The letter also reveals J.B.S.'s plans to travel to "Orange," likely referring to Orange County, Florida. This area, like Polk County, was integral to Florida's citrus industry. The interconnectedness of these agricultural communities is evident as J.B.S. coordinates his travel plans and communicates the logistics of sending oranges. This simple act of sending oranges not only underscores the economic activities central to their livelihood but also reflects the close-knit nature of agricultural communities in the Southeast.
        </p>
        <p>
            The letter provides a glimpse into the family dynamics and responsibilities of the time. J.B.S. expresses his eagerness to see his children and mentions the settled status of "Sis & Pete." The familial ties are strong, and J.B.S.'s concern for his family is palpable. His mention of writing to her and not receiving a response adds a layer of emotional depth, revealing the challenges of maintaining communication over long distances.
        </p>
        <p>
            Interestingly, the letter repeatedly refers to "her" without specifying who she is. The cryptic nature of this communication suggests a need for privacy, as postcards were often readable by the public. Families tended to be discreet about personal matters, avoiding explicit details that could be understood by strangers. This "her" could be another family member, a close friend, or perhaps someone involved in a situation requiring discretion. The concern for her well-being and the attempts to contact her without success add a layer of mystery to the narrative, hinting at unresolved issues or ongoing worries.
        </p>
        <p>
            The early 20th century was a period of significant economic and social change in the United States, particularly in the South. Florida's economy was transitioning from its reliance on phosphate mining to include a robust agricultural sector, primarily driven by citrus production. The development of railroads facilitated the transportation of goods, including oranges, to other parts of the country, boosting the local economy.
        </p>
        <p>
            In South Carolina, the economy was also undergoing changes. While agriculture remained dominant, industrialization was slowly taking root. Florence, where Jasper resided, was becoming a hub for transportation and industry due to its strategic location at the intersection of major railroads.
        </p>
        <p>
            J.B.S.'s decision to travel to Florida and his involvement in the citrus industry suggest that he may have been seeking better economic opportunities. As an orange picker or a worker in the packing house, he would have been part of the labor force that supported Florida's growing agricultural economy. The mention of "they" paying his fare likely refers to the company he worked for, highlighting the employer's role in facilitating labor mobility. His plans to visit his children and the logistical considerations he outlines indicate a strong sense of duty and responsibility towards his family.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Jasper, receiving such a letter from his father would have been a crucial lifeline, providing news and reassurance about the well-being of his family. The letter not only conveys everyday concerns but also reflects the broader economic and social contexts of the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            This postcard serves as a tangible link to the past, offering insights into the personal and economic dynamics of early 20th-century Florida and South Carolina. It reminds us of the resilience and resourcefulness of families during this period, as they navigated the challenges of their time with care and dedication. By examining such artifacts, we gain a deeper understanding of our shared history and the enduring human connections that transcend time. The story of J.B.S. and Jasper is a testament to the enduring bonds of family and the pursuit of better opportunities in a rapidly changing world.
